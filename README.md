# code_sample

This data exploration exercise is a hobby project to look at how and where Boston's bikeshare program is being used.

It demonstrates:

  -Accessing, importing, cleaning, and merging data from different sources

  -Using Google's geocode API

  -Manipulating dataframes, including applying complex formulas to perform calculations on the data

  -Network analysis, including to identify central nodes

  -Plotting across a number of formats

  -Dealing with large datasets

  -Using timeseries for analysis and resampling timeseries

The data (sourced from the Hubway and IRS websites) is contained in the Google Drive folder <a href="http://bit.ly/2G4s7Ht">here</a>. It spans 38 csv's containing individual trip data, the Hubway station location csv, and a csv from the IRS containing zipcode-level data on income.

The next step in this project would be to source American Community Survey-style commute data for the Boston area.

As written here this is meant to be run in Jupyter Notebook. (To run in a shell print statements would need to be added to show the various tables produced by the analysis.)
